## Predicting Methane Emissions from Cattle

#### By: David Lopez

Methane emissions produced by ruminant livestock, such as cattle and sheep, are difficult to measure for a general population. In order to get the most accurate readings for methane production from a single cow, the cow must be attached to a respirator system that measures gas emissions from the cow over a period of time. The goal of my project is to use findings from these reported individual emissions to predict methane emissions for a generalized population of cows based on individual characteristics of the cows, such as differences in diet and size. The project report begins by explaining the problem at hand and why this area of study should be of importance. This includes looking at prior research aimed at addressing the problem. Then, I discuss how I produced my prediction model and corresponding findings. Finally, I conclude with thoughts about the success of the project and potential opportunities for expansion of analysis.
